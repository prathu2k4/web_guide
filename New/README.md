## 📖 How to Use This Guide

### 1. **Follow Phases Sequentially**
Each phase builds upon the previous one. Complete them in order for best results.

### 2. **Test After Each Phase**
Run `npm run dev` and verify everything works before moving to the next phase.

### 3. **Commit Your Progress**
Consider making git commits after each phase to track your progress.

### 4. **Customize as You Go**
Feel free to modify colors, content, and styling to match your personal brand.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Start with Phase 1:**
```bash
# Follow the commands in Phase-1-Project-Setup.md
npx create-next-app@latest pratham-portfolio --typescript --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
```

2. **Work through each phase systematically**
3. **Test frequently using:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 📋 Development Commands

```bash
# Development server
npm run dev

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix

# Code formatting
npm run format
npm run format:check

# Production build
npm run build
npm run start

# Clean build artifacts
npm run clean
```

## 🎨 Customization Guide

### Colors & Theming
- Modify CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css`
- Update theme colors for your personal brand
- Customize gradient colors and effects

### Content & Data
- Update personal information in `src/lib/data/`
- Replace project data with your own projects
- Modify skills and achievements to reflect your experience

### Layout & Design
- Adjust spacing and typography in CSS variables
- Customize component layouts in individual files
- Modify animations and transitions to your preference

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Theme toggle not working:**
- Ensure you've wrapped your app with ThemeProvider
- Check that `next-themes` is properly installed

**Navigation not scrolling:**
- Verify smooth scroll hook implementation
- Check that section IDs match navigation href values

**Animations not playing:**
- Ensure Framer Motion is properly installed
